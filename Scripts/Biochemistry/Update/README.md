# There's three groups of scripts here for updating the database

## A: Adding new biochemistry altogether
./Add_New_Compounds.py
./Merge_Formulas.py
./Add_New_Reactions.py

Additional documentation on adding a new biochemistry is found in
the [../../Provenance/README.md](Provenance) folder

## B: Adding or removing an attribute for a biochemical entity
this will rarely be needed, but a user can extend or delimit the
fields they want for their own uses

./Add_New_Biochemistry_Attribute.py
./Remove_Biochemistry_Attribute.py

## C: Removing obsolete entities after curation.

When new biochemistry is added, but it is found that it is obsolete because it matches
what is already in the database, then these scripts will make sure
they are deleted

./Remove_Newly_Obsolescent_Compounds.py
./Remove_Newly_Obsolescent_Reactions.py

## NB: If any of these are run, all scripts in the Refresh folder must be run in order to make sure
## the entire database is up to date.
