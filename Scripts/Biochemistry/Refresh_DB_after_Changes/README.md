# Order with which these scripts should be run. If nothing has been changed in the
# database, then these scripts will then not change anything, which you can check
# using git diff

There are two shell scripts that run these in the appropriate order:
./Refresh_Reactions.sh
./Refresh_Aliases.sh

# 1) This one attempts to balance "out" compounds, and is key for
# identifying reactions wherein the updated stoichiometry should be
# adjusted for the purposes of FBA.
./Rebuild_Reactions.py

# 3) This one calculates the new status of the reaction based on how the mass
# and charge balances out in the reactants and products. Its different from
# Rebuild_Reactions.py because it doesn't attempt to change the stoichiometry
# but it does ignore duplicate compounds
./Rebalance_Reactions.py

# 4) These two scripts take the result of the prior script, and uses it to find
# reactions which can be balanced with protons and water. They print out results
# in an output file
./Adjust_Reaction_Protons.py
./Adjust_Reaction_Water.py

# 4) This one matches reaction stoichiometry and indicates which reactions
# are now obsolete.
./Merge_Reactions.py

NB: if it is reported that compounds and reactions are now obsolete, and the 
new entities have been added since 2018, they may have to be removed.
The scripts for this should likely be run separately:
./Remove_Newly_Obsolescent_Compounds.py
./Remove_Newly_Obsolescent_Reactions.py

(compounds are only merged manually via curation, see ../../Curation/Redundancies)

# 5) This script takes the output of Merge_Reactions.py and makes sure that all the
# aliases are consistently applied to linked reactions and compounds
./Merge_Obsolete_Aliases.py

# 6) Based on how aliases are updated, they are usually only updated in the 'Aliases' files,
# so these two scripts makes sure that they are updated in the actual database. They have
# some rules for what gets updated so not to overwhelm the user
./Update_Compound_Aliases_in_DB.py
./Update_Reaction_Aliases_in_DB.py
