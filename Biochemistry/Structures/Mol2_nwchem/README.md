mol2:

mol2 files of each compound is generated from the NWChem optimized geometeries for Yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica). 
InChIKey string is used to label each compound and partial charges are taken from the NWChem optimized geometries. 

NWChem:
		NWChem computational chemistry cod was used to optimize the structure of each compound. The compound 		 list of yeast is taken from YarrowiaCyc.


InChIKey:
		InChIKey string is used to label each compound and partial charges are taken from the NWChem optimized geometries.
